1. Download the script file `basicswap_install.sh`
2. Open a terminal in the folder where the file was downloaded and run the following command `chmod +x basicswap_install.sh` to make the script executable.
3. Execute the script by running `./basicswap_install.sh`

NB! When the script terminastes make sure that you write down the recovery phrase that will be printed out!!!
