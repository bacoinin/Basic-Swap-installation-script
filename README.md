# Basic-Swap-installation-script
This is a Basic Swap DEX installation script without docker. Its based on the instructions provided on:
https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_installation.html#install-without-docker, so instead of running the commands one by one, you can simply run this script once. 

In order to do so, you need to open a terminal and:

1. Run `wget https://github.com/bacoinin/Basic-Swap-installation-script/blob/main/basicswap_install.sh` to download the bash script file
2. Run the following command `chmod +x basicswap_install.sh` to make the script executable.
3. Execute the script by running `./basicswap_install.sh`

NB! When the script terminastes make sure that you write down the recovery phrase that will be printed out!!!
